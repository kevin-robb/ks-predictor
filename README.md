Supervised Learning project for CS 4033/5033: Machine Learning.
Group members: Kevin Robb and Logan Elliott.

In this project, we seek to train a supervised learning algorithm to predict a Kickstarter project's success or failure. We are using [a dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects) that contains over 300,000 projects with information like date, deadline, number of pledges, and whether or not it was successful. We will be using Decision Trees and Regression as our main two approaches, and will be comparing them to human performance, a random agent, and to the much more optimal scikit-learn functions.
